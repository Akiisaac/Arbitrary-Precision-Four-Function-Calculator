# Arbitrary-Precision-Four-Function-Calculator
This is an arbitrary precision four function calculator that uses linked lists to store the digits

For now, this only works for whole numbers, not decimals.

Will update with other 3 functions, subtraction, multiplication and division.

Also update with getting input from user, still trying to figure and decide how to do that, whether, get each digit then enter, or get the whole number then put each digit in a list.

Also will try to make it run from the terminal with arguments for easy use.

Obviously, add the 2 c files to compilation, then add debugging flag.

gcc main.c listFunction.c -o -g calc
(idk what goes on on windows, but will add anything if important)
