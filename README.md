# Arbitrary-Precision-Four-Function-Calculator
An arbitrary four-function calculator is a versatile computational tool designed to handle a spectrum of numerical inputs with precision. The 'arbitrary' aspect liberates it from constraints, allowing users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations without predefined limits on the numerical values. This flexibility caters to a diverse range of applications, accommodating both small-scale calculations and larger-than-life numerical manipulations.

#Features & Limitations
1. APFFC makes use of linked lists(single linked lists) to achieve the arbitrary feature. For now, there are no command line arguments, and input uses a 'digit-by-digit' approach.
2. Division is the only operation thats 'incomplete' as there is still a denominator limit.
3. APFFC is a console only application. No GUI.
4. Ready binary/executable only exists for Linux currently, so manual compilation is needed on Windows and Mac.

#Usage :
On Linux : 
  Run APPFC binary to start the menu then follow instructions

On Windows and Mac : 
  Compile both main.c and calculato.c to produce the executable, 
  Run the executable in console/command line, then follow instructions
